Keep creating all api calls and then try to minimize work on components (reeduce effects)


TODO: 
    -> Sidebar
        -> Layout
        -> Extra information (footer info) such as current mode (movie, game etc)
        -> Search bar
        -> Filter by genre
        -> Select random movie by genre

    -> Create area for loading, error and states.

    -> Later:
        -> Create separate loading for each state (list, movie and movieByGenres)
        -> Layout and responsivity on all pages.
        -> Add animation to prod details on movie/:id
        -> Add carousel effect on similar movies
        -> Only show info that actually exists, if not, show add in a box that tells which info isnt there
        -> Componentizar +
        -> Use 'similar' route to get similar movies

    -> Games...
    

MAYBE:
-> Save scroll position on context, so it can reset when changing categories (?)
